## What's this?

A WebAssembly interpreter.

You can try it out on [webassembly.sh](https://webassembly.sh/?run-command=toywasm%20--version).

Note: the binary published on wapm.io is built with an ancient
wasi-sdk to workaroud [an webassembly.sh issue](https://github.com/wasmerio/webassembly.sh/issues/105).

## Goals

* Learn the specs by implementing it
* Have a fun

## Non-goals

* Stable API/ABI
