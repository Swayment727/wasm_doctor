## What's this?

A WebAssembly interpreter.

You can try it out on [webassembly.sh](https://webassembly.sh/?run-command=toywasm%20--version).

Note: the binary published to wapm.io is built with an ancient
wasi-sdk to workaround [an webassembly.sh issue](https://github.com/wasmerio/webassembly.sh/issues/105).

## Goals

* Learn the spec by implementing it
* Have a fun

## Non-goals

* Performance
* Stable API/ABI
